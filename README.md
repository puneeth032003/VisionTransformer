# Vision Transformer on CIFAR-10

## Overview
This project implements a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
It demonstrates how transformers, originally designed for NLP, can be adapted for computer vision tasks.

## Dataset
- **CIFAR-10**: 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- Training images: 50,000
- Test images: 10,000

## Notebook
The main notebook is located in the `notebooks/` folder:
- `Vision_Transformers_CIFAR10.ipynb`

You can run it directly on **Google Colab**.

## Installation
Install required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
